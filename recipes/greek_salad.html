    <h2>This easy Greek salad recipe is our new favorite summer side dish!</h2>
    <p>
      I love a good green salad â€“ mixed greens, romaine, and kale are some of my
      favorite starting points for fresh, healthy meals. But summer is a time
      when all vegetables are at their peak. Sweet, juicy tomatoes, snappy bell
      peppers, and crisp cucumbers abound. This Greek salad recipe showcases
      these veggies, without any greens to get in the way.
