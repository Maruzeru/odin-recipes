    <h2>How to cook steak – the cheffy way!</h2>
    <p>
      Pan seared and basted with garlic thyme butter! It’s dramatic, simple
      cooking at its best, you’ll look like a total pro and feel like you’re
      dining at the best steakhouse in town.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Thickish cut steak</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through
        evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for
        the very centre to be cooked to your liking;
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this
        helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;
      </li>

      <li>
        Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for
        the crust
      </li>

      <li>
        WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!
      </li>

      <li>
        Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature
        (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise
        as it rests; and
      </li>

      <li>
        REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in
        and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook
        hard and fast!
      </li>
